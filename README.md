# todolist
My first project using React JS. It is also the final project of the Coders Lab bootcamp.
In the project, you can add your daily tasks to do. You can also mark them as important, done or delete them. 
All tasks are saved to localStorage. You can only have 8 tasks at one time. You can delete all tasks by clicking on the number of tasks.
Tasks also go through simple validation, such as you can not add two identical tasks, you can not add a long task than 80 characters
 You can check project here: https://votex874.github.io/todolist/ .
